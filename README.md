============

Change Gmail looks:

  - Highlight unread Inbox message in All Mail view



Issues:

- The highlighted Inbox message in All Mail view won't be de-highlighted if directly returning from reading the message (such as by keyboard shortcut `ga`). However, if the All Mail view gets refreshed, the highlighted items will get updated.
